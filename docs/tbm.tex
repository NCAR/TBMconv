Bits 59--30 of word~29 (``offset to first file control pointer") of the SYSLBN block (which begins at offset 0) specify the offset, in 60-bit words, from the start of the file (offset 0) to the first file control pointer (see \cref{Sec.FileControlPointer}). Each file control pointer is followed by a set of file history words (see \cref{Sec.FileHistoryWords}).

\chapter{Reference}

\section{Accessability critera} \label{Sec.AccessibilityCriteria}

The accessability critera characters are a character which indicate ``any restrictions on who may have access to the information in this file. A space means unlimited access; any other character means special handling, in a manner to be defined."

\section{SYSLBN}

A SYSLBN block appears at the start of every TBM file, at offset 0. The SYSLBN block could be thought of as being comprised of a header (words 0 through 3), a VOL1 label (words 4--11), a HDR1 label (words 12--19), a HDR2 label (words 27--28), and finally pointers to various locations in the file (words 28--30).
