# NCAR Terabit Memory System

The NCAR Terabit Memory System was a tape storage system used at NCAR from
approximately the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s. It was based around the
Ampex TMS-4 Terabit Memory System, and included software which ran on a
PDP/11 and CDC 6600/7600. Data stored on high-density TMS-4 tapes was stored
in the TBM format; this repository includes utilities to examine and extract
the contents of TBM archives.
